    <ul>
      <li><strong>I</strong> - He named the month July after himself.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>II</strong> - Caesar is not his family name, but a cognomen that means 'Hairy'. His legacy was so strong that future rulers modeled their title after him. Kaiser and Tsar are a few examples.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>III</strong> - He was kidnapped by pirates, swearing to them that if he was freed he would exact his revenge. Years later, freed, he did.
      <li>
        <strong>IV</strong> - He had a son with Cleopatra, called Caesarion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>V</strong> - He died, betrayed by his loyal retainers, stabbed to death in a conspiracy.
